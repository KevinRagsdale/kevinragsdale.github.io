		<description><![CDATA[This is a good picture. My name is Anthony. I met Lance in 2003 when he was working part time in the pool hall here in PA. We too hit it off and he became my best friend (essentially an older brother). He tried to get me to go on that Tennessee trip a few times. Regrettably , I never had the time off or the money to go on the trip (budgeting was never my forte). When i got the call from his sister that he had passed, it shocked me. The night before his service I wrote a few things down that i would say at his service. It was hard to get through but i somehow managed. The star trek quote above, has been and always will be, one of his favorites. when i ended my little speech i used the line from the end of that movie that couldn&#039;t be more true for my departed brother... &quot;Of my friend i can only say this... of all of the souls i have encountered in my travels... his was the most human&quot;. Though it was hard for us to meet up with his work schedule and my daily schedule, i&#039;m going to miss my friend immensely. I felt at times that he was the only one who truly understood me. He was one of very few people that i&#039;d trust with my life. I will send this link to his family so they may see your page.]]></description>
